package prime_number_list;
/**
 * A prime number is an integer (other than 1) that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1. For example,
 * the number 5 is prime because it can only be evenly divided by 1 and 5. The number 6, however, is
 * not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6. Write a class named PrimeNumberList.
 * The class has a method named generate() which can calculate and store the first 100 prime numbers (starting at 2) in a list
 * and a method that returns a String that contains all the prime numbers stored in the list,
 * the numbers in the String are separated by a space.
 * The returned String should not have leading and ending spaces.
 * The sample format for the returned String: 2 3 5 7 11 13
